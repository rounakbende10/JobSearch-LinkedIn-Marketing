## Content Guidance and Notes:
- **Frequency:** 5–6 posts/week (M–Sat; optional Sun reflection/advice week 2).
- **Format Mix:** Deep dives, diagrams, debug diaries, polls, story threads, open-source invites.
- **Peak Times:** 9:30–11AM (M, W, F, Sat), 1:30–2PM (T, Th).
- **Hashtag Strategy:** Combine stack/tech-focused tags (#LLM, #MLOps), sector tags (#HealthcareAI, #FinanceAI), and topical (#Benchmarking, #OpenSource). Max 5–6 per post.
- **Engagement Triggers:** All posts close with an open technical question or poll.
- **Industry Angle:** Tech/solution stories reference security/privacy for healthcare, audit/adversarial for finance, scale/latency for tech/e-comm.
- **Trend Tie-In:** Integrate the newest stack/innovation each week—track evolving LLM/infra news for Thursday “innovation” slot.

## Example Post (Wk1 Mon):

**Title:** Behind the Scenes: Scaling LLM RAG Systems to Handle 100M+ QPM on AWS
**Format:** Visual/Diagram + Deep Dive
**Description:**
>
I recently architected a hybrid LLM + RAG pipeline (LangChain, Chroma, Llama-3) for a major platform that crossed 100M user queries/month. Diagrams included—here’s why we chose [stack], how we triaged latency spikes, and where the bottlenecks hit as QPS ramped.

**Hashtags:** #LLM #RAG #MLOps #AWS #SystemDesign #TechLeadership
**CTA:** How would you optimize further or spot bottlenecks?

*Repeat for each post using above topic/format matrix. Adjust language/hashtags per sector. End each with a question targeting feedback from senior engineers/tech leads.*

## Tips for Maximizing Visibility and Senior-Level Engagement
- Tag collaborators, tools, or groups referenced in diagrams/stories.
- Regularly reply to all technical comments (“debug in public”).
- Pin highest engagement posts to profile for recruiter visibility.
- Track engagement; iterate on top-performing topics/formats weekly.
