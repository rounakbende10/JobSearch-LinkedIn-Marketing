    - Detail challenges, outages, debugging steps, and resolutions
    - Highlight lessons learned and process improvements
- **Deployment Stories:**
    - Quantify impact (requests/day, latency reduction, cost savings)
    - Explain sector-specific constraints (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, real-time auditability for finance)
- **Stack Integration Highlights:**
    - Walkthroughs integrating RAG, vector DBs, orchestration, and serving infra
    - Step-by-step code/image breakdowns

## 3. Weekly Content Schedule (3–5 Posts/Week)
Consistent cadence is crucial for building senior-level followership and engagement. Use this posting schedule as a template:

| Day       | Content Type                                    | Focus/Theme                                           | Engagement CTA                        |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Mon/Tue   | Technical Deep Dive or Architecture Breakdown   | LLM/RAG system, production pipeline, cost benchmarks  | "How would you scale this further?"   |
| Wed       | Postmortem or Debug Story                       | Real-world bug fix, incident lesson, compliance hurdle| "What was your toughest fix this year?"|
| Thu       | Innovation or Benchmark Roundup                 | New tech, open-source tools, feature launches         | "Have you tried this stack?"          |
| Fri/Sat   | Discussion, Peer Engagement, or Poll            | Debate: e.g., RAG vs. agentic architectures           | Poll + "Vote/share real-world issues!"|


Example Monthly Plan:
- 2–4 In-depth technical articles/posts
- 1–2 Architecture diagrams/visual posts
- 1–2 System/incident retros or lessons learned
- 2+ Sector-specific / innovation commentary threads

End every major post with an open-ended technical question or poll inviting peer input.

---

## 4. Networking & Senior Audience Engagement
- **Proactive Peer Commenting:** Comment on other architects’/leads’ posts with actionable, constructive feedback (avoid generic praise).
- **Tag Industry Leaders:** Where appropriate, tag collaborators and technical mentors in your stories for visibility and credibility.
- **Polls & Open Technical Debates:** Regular polls targeting dilemmas faced by senior architects (e.g., compliance vs. speed, vector DB choices, real-time auditability).
- **Technical Counterpoints:** Occasionally challenge prevalent opinions or surface caveats—senior engineers value open, nuanced debates.
- **Featured Section Curation:** Pin your best architecture breakdowns, open-source repos, technical win stories, and prominent talks.
- **Direct Outreach/Connection Requests:** Personalized notes referencing technical pain points or innovations relevant to their industry (e.g., “Saw your recent talk about federated learning in healthtech—let’s connect around privacy-centric deployments!”)
